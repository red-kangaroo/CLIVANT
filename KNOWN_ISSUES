Bugs that will crash CLIVAN:

-	Praying to Silva while on the 5th floor or the 6th floor in gloomy caves, DON'T DO IT. The earthquake bug still exists.

- Wishing for a flaming sword results in a crash

-	When editing the dungeon script files, one must presently specify GenerateWards to be true or false, otherwise the game will crash.


Bugs that won't crash CLIVAN:

-	It is known that certain hostile dolphins will follow the player to other levels


Submit any bugs that occur to Warheck, or lampshade at www.attnam.com

I would recommend keeping the AutoSave count at 1. Because I've had some crashes that's happened for no reason.
